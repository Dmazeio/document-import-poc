It supports accountability across different roles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🚩 Tips\n\n- Make sure 'Responsible' and 'Due Date' are filled in before starting implementation.  \n- Use “Exists” only when the action is already implemented and verifiable.  \n- Measures are considered **closed** when status is: **Existing**, **Cancelled**, or **Completed (100%) (approved)**.  \n- Emails are automatically sent when a measure is assigned, declined, completed, cancelled, or approved.  \n- If a measure is rejected after completion, the responsible person must continue working until it can be approved.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n📌 Examples\n\n- A user creates a measure and selects “Do not implement”. The status becomes **Cancelled**, and the measure is closed.  \n- A responsible user accepts a measure, completes it, and the initiator approves it.
