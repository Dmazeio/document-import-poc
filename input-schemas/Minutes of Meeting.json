Email notifications are triggered at key decision points to keep responsible parties informed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🎯 Purpose\n\nTo track and manage the lifecycle of a measure, ensure all stakeholders are aligned, and maintain control over implementation, acceptance, and completion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n👥 Roles\n\n**Initiator** (e.g. process owner, risk owner, team lead):  \n- Creates the measure and chooses between implementing, acknowledging it already exists, or cancelling it.  \n- Assigns a responsible person and sets a due date if implementation is selected.  \n- Approves, cancels, or rejects the completed measure.\n\n**Measure Responsible**:  \n- Accepts, declines, cancels, or closes the measure as “Existing” or “Do not implement”.  \n- Updates progress status during implementation.  \n- Marks the measure as complete for approval.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n💡 Why this matters\n\nA well-defined status lifecycle ensures consistent handling of all measures, enables transparency, automates follow-up through email notifications, and defines clear closure criteria. It supports accountability across different roles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🚩 Tips\n\n- Make sure 'Responsible' and 'Due Date' are filled in before starting implementation.  \n- Use “Exists” only when the action is already implemented and verifiable.  \n- Measures are considered **closed** when status is: **Existing**, **Cancelled**, or **Completed (100%) (approved)**.  \n- Emails are automatically sent when a measure is assigned, declined, completed, cancelled, or approved.  \n- If a measure is rejected after completion, the responsible person must continue working until it can be approved.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n📌 Examples\n\n- A user creates a measure and selects “Do not implement”. The status becomes **Cancelled**, and the measure is closed.  \n- A responsible user accepts a measure, completes it, and the initiator approves it. The status becomes **Completed (100%) (approved)**, and the process is complete.\n\n💬 **Want to see the actual lifecycle for this measure?**  \nClick the **Change log** button in the top-right corner above this field to view the full step-by-step history, including who made each change and when.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n📊 Status Lifecycle Overview\n\n1. **Measure is created** → `Identified (pending decision)` *(System)*  \n2. **Initiator clicks**:\n   - *Implement* → Requires Responsible + Due date → `To be implemented (pending accept)` *(email sent to Responsible)*  \n   - *Exists* → `Existing` *(Closed)*  \n   - *Do not implement* → `Cancelled` *(Closed)*\n3. **Responsible user chooses**:\n   - *Decline* → `To be implemented (declined)` *(email sent to Initiator)*  \n   - *Accept* → `In progress (not started)` → Access to:\n     - `In progress (25%)`, `In progress (50%)`, `In progress (75%)`\n     - `Completed (100%) (for approval)` *(email sent to Initiator)*  \n     - *Cancel* → `In progress (cancelled)` *(email sent to Initiator)*  \n   - *Exists* → `Existing` *(Closed)*  \n   - *Do not implement* → `Cancelled` *(Closed)*\n4. **Initiator chooses**:\n   - *Approve* → `Completed (100%) (approved)` *(Closed)*  \n   - *Reject* → `Completed (100%) (not approved)` *(measure reopens)*  \n   - *Cancel* → `In progress (cancelled)` *(Closed)*\n\n&nbsp;\n\n✅ When is a measure considered closed?\n\n- `Existing`  \n- `Cancelled`  \n- `Completed (100%) (approved)`\n\n&nbsp;\n\n⚠️ Note: The list of selectable status options and transitions may be customised by your organisation’s administrator to reflect internal processes and governance.",
