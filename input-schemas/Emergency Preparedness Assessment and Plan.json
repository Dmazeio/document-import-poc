  "description": "An **Emergency Preparedness Assessment and Plan** is a structured method for **evaluating emergency scenarios and establishing plans to prevent, respond to, and recover from critical incidents**. It can be used to improve organizational resilience and ensure compliance with safety and emergency regulations across locations and operations.\n\n\n\nAn **Emergency Preparedness Assessment and Plan** is based on your facilities, activities, risk scenarios, or regulatory requirements and provides a framework for assessing vulnerabilities and developing appropriate response measures. In this template you can describe the emergency context and plan corresponding actions. For each scenario or preparedness area, you can describe:\n\n\n\n*   Potential emergency events and triggers\n\n*   Critical assets, personnel, and exposure areas\n\n*   Existing emergency systems and resources\n\n*   Planned actions, procedures, and drills\n\n*   Responsible roles and follow-up activities\n\n\n\nWith this template, you get a complete emergency preparedness process — from identifying potential scenarios and evaluating readiness, to developing response plans, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring follow-up and continual improvement.",

It is intended for linking to web-based resources — not to other records within Dmaze (for that, use the Related to field). When adding a link, you can also provide a human-readable description (link title) to clearly indicate what the link is for. This makes it easier for others to understand the purpose of the link without having to click on it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🎯 Purpose\n\nTo give users direct access to relevant online content that supports understanding, implementation, or verification of the record.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n👥 Roles\n\n- Record Owner or Contributor: Adds and maintains the list of links.\n- Participants and Reviewers: Use the links to access additional details, evidence, or background.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n💡 Why this matters\n\nLinks provide instant access to supporting materials, reducing the need for manual searches and ensuring all stakeholders work from the same trusted sources. Where possible, use this field instead of attaching documents directly — linked resources respect existing access permissions and security controls on the hosting platform.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🚩 Tips\n\n- You can add multiple links.\n- Use complete, valid, and accessible URLs.\n- Always provide a short, meaningful description for each link so users know what to expect before clicking.\n- Regularly check and update links to avoid broken or outdated references.\n- If linking to documents that require controlled access, ensure permissions are properly managed on the hosting platform.\n- Prefer using links instead of attachments for resources that are maintained elsewhere — this helps ensure everyone always sees the latest version.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n📌 Examples\n\n- Data Protection Policy – https://intranet.example.com/policies/data-protection\n- Project 42 Overview – https://projects.example.com/initiative-42\n- Regulatory Guidelines – Section 5 – https://regulator.example.org/guidelines/section-5",
