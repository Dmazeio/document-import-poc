The status updates automatically based on user decisions and system events, and determines when an action is considered closed. Email notifications are triggered at key decision points to keep responsible parties informed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🎯 Purpose\n\nTo track and manage the lifecycle of an action, ensure all stakeholders are aligned, and maintain control over implementation, acceptance, and completion.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n👥 Roles\n\n**Initiator** (e.g. process owner, risk owner, team lead):  \n- Creates the action and chooses between implementing, acknowledging it already exists, or cancelling it.  \n- Assigns a responsible person and sets a due date if implementation is selected.  \n- Approves, cancels, or rejects the completed action.\n\n**Action Responsible**:  \n- Accepts, declines, cancels, or closes the action as “Existing” or “Do not implement”.  \n- Updates progress status during implementation.  \n- Marks the action as complete for approval.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n💡 Why this matters\n\nA well-defined status lifecycle ensures consistent handling of all actions, enables transparency, automates follow-up through email notifications, and defines clear closure criteria. It supports accountability across different roles.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n🚩 Tips\n\n- Make sure 'Responsible' and 'Due Date' are filled in before starting implementation.  \n- Use “Exists” only when the action is already implemented and verifiable.  \n- Actions are considered **closed** when status is: **Existing**, **Cancelled**, or **Completed (100%) (approved)**.  \n- Emails are automatically sent when an action is assigned, declined, completed, cancelled, or approved.  \n- If an action is rejected after completion, the responsible person must continue working until it can be approved.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n📌 Examples\n\n- A user creates an action and selects “Do not implement”. The status becomes **Cancelled**, and the action is closed.  \n- A responsible user accepts an action, completes it, and the initiator approves it.
